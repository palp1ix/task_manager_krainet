# Testing Strategy for Task Manager App

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy implemented for the Task Manager application.

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
Located in `/test/unit/`, these tests verify individual components in isolation by mocking dependencies.

- **BLoC Tests**: Test state management logic
  - Verify initial states
  - Verify state transitions when events are added
  - Ensure correct side effects occur

- **Repository Tests**: Verify repository layer logic
  - Test data fetching from both remote and local sources
  - Test caching mechanisms
  - Test error handling

- **Model Tests**: Verify model parsing and serialization
  - Test JSON serialization/deserialization
  - Test data validation

### 2. Widget Tests
Located in `/test/widget/`, these tests verify UI components render correctly and respond to interactions.

- **Screen Tests**: Test complete screens
  - Verify UI elements are rendered
  - Test user interactions (button taps, form submissions)
  - Test navigation events

- **Golden Tests**: Verify visual appearance
  - Compare rendered widgets against saved "golden" images
  - Test on multiple device sizes
  - Test both light and dark themes

### 3. Integration Tests
Located in `/integration_test/`, these tests verify multiple components working together.

- End-to-end user flows
- Authentication process
- Task creation, update, and deletion flows
- Navigation between screens

### 4. Localization Tests
Located in `/test/unit/localization/`, these tests verify the app's localization system.

- Verify text appears correctly in different languages
- Test locale switching
- Ensure all user-facing strings are localized

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all unit and widget tests
flutter test

# Run integration tests
flutter test integration_test/app_test.dart

# Generate coverage report
flutter test --coverage
```

## Test Dependencies

- **mockito**: For creating mock objects
- **bloc_test**: For testing BLoCs
- **golden_toolkit**: For golden image testing
- **integration_test**: For integration testing

## Best Practices

1. **Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical paths
2. **Isolated Tests**: Keep tests isolated and independent
3. **Readable Tests**: Use descriptive test names and clear assertions
4. **Maintainable Tests**: Structure tests to be easily maintained as the codebase evolves
